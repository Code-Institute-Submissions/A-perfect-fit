A Perfect Fit
It is an online shopping website which sells high quality fitness clothes (initially it will be just leggings). The clothes will all be Brazilian brands, which have a distinctive design. 
Why? 
•	Market Gap/Opportunity
In the US and the UK there are websites that are successfully selling these kind of Brazilian premium fashion leggings but these companies make it very unattractive for Irish customers as there is an extra premium on delivery costs and time of delivery to Ireland is very slow. The companies are not setup to exploit a smaller overseas market. It is far from their priority. They do not promote their product to the Irish market. 


It’s clear that the female legging market in Ireland has grown rapidly over the last few years, and obviously as such there is now a market for a greater variety of leggings. Firstly, the colours are more exciting, they are much bolder than the ones available in Ireland. Secondly and maybe more importantly, the Brazilian material is thinner so it shows off the body more, and this is now a big trend in Ireland. Keep physically fit and show off the results as best as possible, in and out of the gym. The word “Fit” was very important for me to use in the name as it has multiple relevant meanings to my brand and it’s a word that highly searched on google. 

I understand that at present it’s probably not possible to compete with the big clothes companies in Ireland on a very large scale, but that does not mean I can’t operate and be very profitable in this niche market. I have contacts of people in Brazil who can supply me with the leggings. I can ship them over together at a low cost per unit and will have the ability to have them delivered to my customers within a day or two. I don’t have any significant labour cost, have no fixed assets or rent. Everything can be done from home. It requires low investment and is low risk.

Testing
The customers user story I believed achieved the intended outcome as it provided quality pictures and information of the products, information about the company and the opportunity to join our e-mail subscription list.
In the About Us section, they can read about the company, payment options and also delivery information. In the “About Us Additional Info” they can read about: the return policy, privacy notice  / Security, and terms and conditions. 
In the Leggings section, they can select one of the 3 options: New Arrivals, Summer Collection and On Sale. Here they can see high quality images of the Leggings with their price displayed. The On Sale Section has the pre-sale price scratched off which improves the appeal. 
In the Contact Us section, they can see our e-mail address, whatsapp contact and the address of the company. There is also a Google maps location link that they click on and I have set this up so that the link opens in a new tab. The link will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank".
Customers can join our e-mail subscription list, by clicking on the green “Join Us” button, and filling out the form. If they try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. 
All links have been tested manually to make sure that they are being directed to the right destinations. 
This site was tested on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
